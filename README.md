CoopCycle
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/coopcycle/coopcycle-web.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/coopcycle/coopcycle-web)

CoopCycle is a **self-hosted** platform to order meals in your neighborhood and get them delivered by bike couriers. The only difference with proprietary platforms as Deliveroo or UberEats is that this software is [reserved to co-ops](#license).

The main idea is to **decentralize** this kind of service and to allow couriers to **own the platform** they are working for.
In each city, couriers are encouraged to organize into co-ops, and to run their very own version of the software.

The software is under active development. If you would like to contribute we will be happy to hear from you! All instructions are [in the Contribute file](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Coopcycle-web is the main repo, containing the web API, the front-end for the website and the dispatch algorithm : [Â Technical Overview ](https://github.com/coopcycle/coopcycle-web/wiki/Technical-Overview). You can see it in action & test it here : https://demo.coopcycle.org

You can find a comprehensive list of our repos here : [ Our repos comprehensive list ](https://github.com/coopcycle/coopcycle-web/wiki/Our-repos-comprehensive-list).

How to run a local instance

### Prerequisites

* Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). On OSX/Windows we advise you to install the latest versions available, which don't rely on Virtualbox.

* Create a Stripe account and copy your tests credentials. You will be asked for them when running `make install`.

* Run the install scripts
```sh
make install
```


### Run the application

* Start the Docker containers
```
docker-compose up
```

* Open the platform in your browser
```
open http://localhost
```
